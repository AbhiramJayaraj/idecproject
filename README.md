# IEDC Web Portal Project  
**Repository:** [AbhiramJayaraj / idecproject](https://github.com/AbhiramJayaraj/idecproject)  

## 📌 Project Purpose & Context  
This project was completed as a task for the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Development Cell (IEDC). The objective was to build a web-portal to support IEDC activities — enabling management of events, members, startups, communications, and tracking of entrepreneurial initiatives within the institution.

## ✔️ My Role & Completion Status  
- I personally developed the entire front-end of the portal, from scratch, using the specified tech stack.  
- The project has been completed and delivered as per the assignment brief to IEDC: all intended features are implemented to the required level.  
- The delivered solution is ready for review and deployment by the Web Manager / IEDC committee.

## 🧩 Key Features Implemented  
- A clean, responsive UI for IEDC management: event creation, member registrations, startup proposals, progress tracking.  
- Admin/Manager dashboard to view and manage registered members, startups, and event workflows.  
- Real-time/in-session updates: e.g., new submissions visible immediately, status updates from committee.  
- Mobile-friendly design — so users (students, members) can access the portal from phones as well as desktops.  
- Build and deployment setup: production build ready, optimized assets, routing handled. (See **Getting Started** below.)

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (bootstrapped via Create React App)  
- **Styling / UI:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Build & Deployment Scripts:** `npm start`, `npm run build`, etc., as standard with CRA.
